Linnstrument Helper is a SwiftUI app for Mac OS to help make learning the Linnstrument layout a breeze. Just like a bass guitar, the Linnstrument uses [all fourths tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_fourths_tuning). 

Currently in a beta stage, Linnstrument helper makes use of the [AudioKit](https://github.com/AudioKit/AudioKit) and [SwiftUI Grid](https://github.com/spacenation/swiftui-grid) frameworks.
